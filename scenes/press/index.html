        <ul>
          <li><strong>A better-than-ever app experience.</strong> This year, the Android App is better than ever. You'll be able to play all of the games available on your desktop, as well as the Android-exclusive game: Santa Snap. Fly your jetpack-powered elf around the world to take photos of world landmarks and help Santa on his journey.</li>
          <li><strong>New Games.</strong> Let your imagination and inner-artist soar with Santa's Canvas, help teach Santa's robot how to recognize holiday doodles, and (sssh, keep it a secret) participate in what could be the largest online multiplayer snowball fight ever. Android users can access the mobile-exclusive Santa Snap game, where you can snap an 'elfie' with landmarks from around the world. See descriptions, images, and videos of the newest experiences below.</li>
          <li><strong>More resources for teachers.</strong> All of the popular educational games are available once again, and this year we've added video tutorials for the associated lesson plans to help teachers who may be less familiar with computer science create a great classroom experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Educational nonprofits.</strong> We've worked with <a href="https://google.org" rel="noopener">Google.org</a> to highlight new nonprofits that work tirelessly year round to improve educational opportunities world wide: Khan Academy, Pratham Books, Libraries without Borders, Code.org, and the Scratch Foundation.</li>
