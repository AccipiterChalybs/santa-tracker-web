        <li><strong>New Games.</strong> Let your imagination and inner-artist soar with Santa's Canvas, help teach Santa's robot how to recognize holiday doodles, and (sssh, keep it a secret) participate in what could be the largest online multiplayer snowball fight ever. Android users can access the mobile-exclusive Santa Snap game, where you can snap an 'elfie' with landmarks from around the world. See descriptions, images, and videos of the newest experiences below.</li>
        <li><strong>More resources for teachers.</strong> All of the popular educational games are available once again, and this year we've added video tutorials for the associated lesson plans to help teachers who may be less familiar with computer science create a great classroom experience.</li>
